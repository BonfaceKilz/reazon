;;; Commentary:

;; Reazon is an implmentation of the miniKanren language for Emacs. It
;; provides an interface for writing an running relational programs.
;; That interface consists of the following macros:

;; * reazon-defrel
;; * reazon-conde
;; * reazon-fresh
;; * reazon-run
;; * reazon-run*

;;; Code:

;; -- Variables --

;; Reazon variables need to be distinct from Lisp symbols. They are
;; implemented here as vectors.

  "Create a unique variable from NAME."
  (vector name))

(defun reazon--variable-p (var)
  "Check whether VAR is a variable."

;; -- Substitutions --

;; An ASSOCIATION is a cons pair whose car is a Reazon variable.

;; A SUBSTITUTION is a list of associations such that no variable is
;; associated more than once and no variable is associated to itself,
;; either directly or through a CYCLE.

;; A variable unassociated in a substitution is FRESH.
